- Use multi-stage builds to separate build-time dependencies from runtime environments.
- Avoid using `latest` tag for base images. Pin to specific versions for reproducibility.
- Use `.dockerignore` to exclude unnecessary files from context (e.g., `node_modules`, `.git`, build artifacts).
- Set `WORKDIR` to provide a clear working directory structure.
- Provide default `CMD` or `ENTRYPOINT` for containers with expected behavior.
- Avoid hardcoding secrets, credentials, or tokens in Dockerfiles. Use environment variables or secrets management tools.
- Always use official base images when available. Prefer slim or alpine variants for minimal attack surface unless full distributions are necessary.
